# Exemplary-Code-Chunk--Analyst-Profile

This repository highlights a chunk of code I am proud of. The code replicates a column plot produced by FiveThirtyEight showing the percentage chance of Democrats and Republicans winning senate seats in the 2022 midterms. The image was replicated for an assignment in SIS-750: Data Analysis, a course at the School of International Service, American University. The FiveThirtyEight image is available in this respository along with the R Script I used to replicate the image and my output. I used ggplot2 to create my replication.
